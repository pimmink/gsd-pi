// File Purpose: Structural guard (D234) that locks the performance-baseline
// gate's isolation/scheduling contract: the benchmark file lives under
// src/tests/performance/ (excluded from the ordinary contended test:unit:compiled
// glob), a dedicated serialized test:unit:compiled:perf script covers it with
// --test-concurrency=1, CI runs that script before the ordinary "Run unit tests"
// step in the build job, and the baseline/tolerances/assertions are unchanged.
// This test is itself in-process and not contention-sensitive, so it stays in
// the ordinary pool, not under src/tests/performance/.
