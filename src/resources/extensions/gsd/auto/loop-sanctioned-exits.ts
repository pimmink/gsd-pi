// Project/App: gsd-pi
// File Purpose: Maps each auto-loop liveness guard id to its owning guard's real
// recovery command, so a tripped wedge names a reachable exit (ADR-047 §5).

/**
 * ADR-047 §5 requires a wedge record to name the sanctioned, state-mutating
 * exit for the guard that blocked. The loop's shared adjudication boundary sees
 * only the guard id and the failure payload, so the owning guard's instruction
 * lives here — copied from where that guard already prints it to users, never
 * invented:
 *
 * - `/gsd rebuild markdown` — the #1520 dispatch stop and the drift reports in
 *   state-reconciliation/drift/* and migration-auto-check.ts.
 * - `/gsd doctor fix` — commands-handlers.ts parseDoctorArgs ("fix" mode).
 * - `/gsd recover <recoveryActionId>` — terminal Task recovery abort notices.
 * - `/gsd status` + `/gsd auto` — lease-conflict-notice.ts.
 * - `/gsd auto` — decideMemoryPressure's own stop message.
 *
 * Every entry is a command that exists today (`/gsd help full` lists them);
 * unknown guard ids fall back to the generic-but-actionable triage pair.
