// Project/App: gsd-pi
// File Purpose: Post-unit hook gate verdict rows. The verdict of a blocking
// post-unit hook (a gate) is a database row; the hook's artifact file is a
// render for the operator and decides nothing. A verdict arrives as a
// gsd_hook_verdict_save tool call, which writes the row (owner default,
// P18d). db/writers/hook-verdicts.ts owns the write SQL.
