/**
 * This matters only when GSD_AUTHORITY_CUTOVER=1 is set; with the flag unset
 * an open does not run the backfill and the call changes no test result.
 * With the flag set, the first open of an old database runs lifecycle
 * backfill. It adopts a legacy completion as completed only with evidence: a Task needs
 * completed_at, a summary and a verification result; a Slice needs
 * completed_at and a summary; a Milestone needs completed_at and one Slice.
 * A fixture that means "this row is complete" calls this before it closes
 * the database; without it the open stops and does not cut the project over.
