## Context

GSD currently expresses workflow authority across database rows, Markdown and
JSONL files, runtime snapshots, process-local counters, several orchestration
loops, and path-specific closeout behavior. Those paths can disagree about the
next work, completion, verification, retry budgets, or whether user input is
required. Repair code then attempts to reconcile the disagreement, sometimes
by reading a projection back into authority or by advancing work that did not
actually succeed.

The product goal is smaller than that machinery: guide a person through what
they want to build, research the uncertain parts, turn the result into
Milestones containing Slices and Tasks, and carry that work to verified
completion. Discovery may last days or weeks and must resume without relying
on one process or one conversation transcript.

## Decision

Adopt one database-authoritative workflow model and incrementally converge all
execution paths on it.

### One hierarchy for discovery and delivery

Every Project uses the ordinary `Milestone -> Slice -> Task` hierarchy.
Milestone Kind describes purpose without creating another lifecycle:

- `discovery`
- `research`
- `requirements`
- `roadmap`
- `delivery`
- `remediation`

A new Project normally begins with four resumable Milestones: product
discovery, domain and technical research, requirements validation, and the
delivery roadmap. Research precedes finalized requirements and roadmap
decisions. New uncertainty creates targeted research dependencies rather than
being guessed away.

Planned start, end, and review dates are advisory forecasts. They never become
readiness rules, timeouts, completion evidence, or automatic blockers.

### Truthful lifecycle and outcomes

Lifecycle Status, immutable Attempt Result, Requirement Disposition, Waiver,
and Blocker are separate concepts.

- An Attempt succeeds, fails, or is interrupted; its history is never erased.
- Failure or interruption never means completion.
- There is no runtime `skipped` outcome. Cancellation plus an authorized
  Waiver represents intentionally omitted work.
- Dependencies unlock only when required work is satisfied or explicitly
  waived by authorized policy.
- Reopening upstream work marks dependency-reachable decisions and evidence
  for revalidation.

### SQLite is the sole Workflow Authority

Normal runtime reads hierarchy, ordering, readiness, lifecycle, questions,
decisions, blockers, waivers, Attempts, recovery state, verification, UAT, and
closeout from one consistent project-database snapshot. Missing or unreadable
authority fails explicitly; runtime does not fall back to files or cached
prose.

Read-only integrations are a display-only compatibility boundary:
`gsd read progress`, `gsd read roadmap` and packaged MCP `gsd_progress`,
`gsd_query`, `gsd_roadmap`, `gsd_doctor` and the `gsd_graph` build may serve
the `.gsd/` projections
only when the project database is missing or cannot be opened, or
when the standalone MCP package has no GSD runtime bridge. Once the database
opens, it remains authoritative and any later read failure is reported instead
of falling back. The web project picker lists projects that the user did not
open, so it reads each project database read-only with no migration, and it
shows the `STATE.md` projection only when that read fails. The web workspace
index, project kind and inspect reads follow the same rule and, like the CLI
and MCP reads, label a fallback result `readMetadata: { source: "projection",
authority: "projection-fallback" }`. This exception cannot drive lifecycle
state.

Only Domain Operations in the Single Writer layer mutate workflow state. A
Domain Operation validates revision, dependencies, lifecycle, lease/fencing,
evidence, and transport idempotency inside one transaction. That transaction
commits the domain change, immutable events and links, durable Projection Work,
and the new database revision together.

Narrative content may be canonical database content, but every machine-relevant
fact has a normalized database representation. Runtime never reconstructs
workflow truth from narrative prose.

Work outside the Milestone hierarchy is in scope when it keeps state. A custom
workflow run (`yaml-step`) and a markdown-phase template run are workflow
state: the run, its frozen definition and its step or phase lifecycle are
database rows, and the files in the run directory are projections. A oneshot
workflow run keeps no state (no run directory, no phase tracking) and is out
of scope of this ADR.

Current effect: a `yaml-step` run is `custom_workflow_runs` and
`custom_workflow_steps` rows written by `custom_workflow.*` Domain Operations,
with one `custom_workflow_step_verifications` evidence row for each
verification. A step with no check records `inconclusive` with a waiver
rationale on that row; it is not a `workflow_waivers` row, because a step has
no lifecycle row. A step with a `human-review` or `prompt-verify` policy
records `inconclusive` with no waiver and pauses the run;
`/gsd workflow approve <name>/<timestamp> <step>` records the decision of the
operator as a `pass` row written by a `user` actor and completes the step, in
one `custom_workflow.step.approve` operation. A
step that auto-mode runs is claimed as a `unit_dispatches` row (ADR-048), so a
second session cannot run it. A step is not a Task: it has no Attempt. The run
revision fence of the Domain Operation is the write safety of the step rows:
each call has its own idempotency key, so a second session that read the same
revision gets a revision conflict and never a silent replay. The
verification retry count of a step is on its step row, written by a
`custom_workflow.step.retry` Domain Operation. The rows are the only
authority: a run directory with no run row (an older release) is imported with
a `custom_workflow.run.import` Domain Operation before the engine reads it,
and an import that is refused (an unknown step status) fails loud and writes
nothing. This import is not an Import Preview. The pause row (`auto_pauses`) is session state,
not run identity: a command that names a run starts that run and drops the
record. A markdown-phase template run still keeps its phase state in
an agent-edited `STATE.json`.

The semantic shadow comparison does not cover custom runs. The `custom` mode
entries of the M003/S07 cutover dossier compare the status of hierarchy items
while a custom run is active; they are not evidence about run or step state.
A custom run has no legacy status to compare with: its rows are the only
authority and the run directory files are renders.

### Markdown and other files are one-way projections

PROJECT, ROADMAP, QUEUE, CONTEXT, PLAN, SUMMARY, ASSESSMENT, UAT,
REQUIREMENTS, RESEARCH, decisions, manifests, compatibility planning trees,
and JSONL audit views are projections or exports only.

Projection Work is durable database state containing desired and rendered
revisions, hashes, attempts, retry timing, and errors. Rendering happens after
the Domain Operation commits and writes atomically. A projection failure is
visible and retryable, but cannot change lifecycle state, satisfy a
dependency, authorize recovery, roll back a committed operation, or block
otherwise valid work. A full projection rebuild is idempotent from the
database.

Agents change a projection only through the tool that owns its state. The
agent write guard (`write-intercept.ts`) refuses a direct write, edit or shell
write to a managed projection that has a save tool and names that tool; the
guarded kinds, the engines it runs on and its limits are in
[`state-db-cutover-projection-contract.md`](state-db-cutover-projection-contract.md),
section 1. The command outputs under `.gsd/spikes`, `.gsd/sketches`,
`.gsd/reviews` and `.gsd/codebase` are non-workflow documents: no workflow
decision reads them, and agents write them directly. A
`/gsd thread` has no typed row; it is a memory entry by prompt convention.

Legacy disk content enters authority only through explicit Import Preview and
Import Application. Preview is read-only, reports exact mappings and loss, and
binds approval to source fingerprints, parser/schema versions, and database
revision. Application requires unchanged inputs, a verified restorable backup,
resolved ambiguity, required consent, and one transaction. Import is never an
implicit startup, database-open, derive-state, dispatch, or reconciliation
behavior.

### One database per bound checkout

The state-directory hash (remote URL or path) only locates a database; it is
not the Project identity. `project_authority` holds a stable `project_id` and
the realpath of the one checkout root the database belongs to. The first open
binds an unbound database. Every later open from another root, such as a second
clone that resolves to the same state directory or a copied `gsd.db`, is
refused with `checkout-unbound` until `/gsd db bind` explicitly moves the
binding. An internal reopen that holds only the database path has no root to
compare, so it checks that the file is the one its bound checkout resolves to.
Worktrees belong to the checkout that created them. One resolver
(`resolveGsdPathContract`) finds the database, anchored on `gsd.db` and
preferences, never on projection files. The binding is not identity: Import
Application restore and Forward Repair match a backup by `project_id`, so a
backup taken before binding (root `''`) or under an earlier binding stays
usable. A restore installs the backup's own binding; when that names another
root, the next open refuses until `/gsd db bind`.

Committed `.gsd/` markdown (tracked mode, team repositories) is an export, not
shared authority. A clone with milestone projections and no database, or a
database with no milestone rows beside a planned (ROADMAP) projection, fails
closed with `authority-missing` in every entry point and every internal reopen
until Import Application (`/gsd recover`), a restore, or the explicit
start-empty choice. The same refusal applies to a git-tracked `PROJECT.md`,
`DECISIONS.md` or `REQUIREMENTS.md` beside no database, or beside a database
with no workflow rows and no Domain Operation: only rows produce these files.
`KNOWLEDGE.md` is not such evidence, because a render with no rows writes its
empty frame. `/gsd db start-empty` stores the choice as one Domain Operation
(`project.start_empty`), so every later open admits the database. It moves and
deletes no file: a milestone that exists only as markdown still blocks dispatch
until the user discards, renames or imports it. A `/gsd recover` that
applies nothing closes the handle it opened, so the same process refuses the
database again. Guided entry holds a changed tracked projection
the same way before its markdown self-heal. A tracked projection changed by pull, merge,
rebase, or branch switch raises one "changed outside GSD" state before
dispatch in auto mode, parallel spawn, guided flow and `/gsd dispatch`: the
user imports it through Import Preview or discards it with a
projection rebuild; GSD never quarantines and re-renders it silently. The
render baseline (`.gsd/.compat.json`) and `.gsd/quarantine/` are runtime files
and are never committed.

### One natural conversation contract

Open Questions, answers, recommendations, Decisions, corrections, and Work
Checkpoints are persisted in the database. Interaction kind is explicit:
`open`, `choice`, `clarification`, `recap`, `consent`, or `subjective-uat`.

The agent asks one focused question in the user's language. Real choices put
the recommendation first and include a plain-language reason, evidence,
confidence, and the uncertainty that could change it. Free-form pushback is
stored separately from its normalized interpretation. Corrections supersede
rather than overwrite prior Decisions and trigger downstream revalidation.

Safe reversible work continues with a recorded recommendation when evidence
and delegated authority permit. Recaps are correction surfaces, not approval
gates. Ordinary choices are not consent.

### One Lifecycle Kernel

One persisted Lifecycle Kernel serves auto, interactive, custom, parallel, and
temporary legacy adapters. Its public control surface is `start`, `advance`,
`resume`, and `stop`. It owns only:

1. **Advance** — read one snapshot, reconcile database invariants, select and
   claim dependency-ready work, and create one fenced Attempt.
2. **Execute** — invoke an executor adapter and persist its immutable result.
3. **Verify** — run required automated criteria and persist fresh evidence.
4. **Route** — select exactly one bounded recovery action.
5. **Closeout** — prepare and settle completion through the shared boundary.

Provider calls, SQL implementation, verification runners, recovery policy,
git/worktree mechanics, projection workers, transports, UI, and parallel
capacity stay in their owning deep modules. They return typed results and do
not mutate lifecycle independently. Parallelism is database-claim concurrency,
not a second lifecycle or a DAG wrapped around one work item.

Attempts are the kernel record of Task execution. For every other unit type the
kernel record is the claimed `unit_dispatches` row. The target is that retry and
recovery budgets, pause state and stage checkpoints are stored on that row.
Today three retry budgets (zero-tool, tool-unavailable and pre-execution
repair), the sidecar queue, the planner retry after a failed pre-execution
check and the stage checkpoint are stored there. The pause is a row of its own
(`auto_pauses`) with a link to the dispatch row. See the amendments in
[ADR-048](ADR-048-unitrun-dispatch-row.md) for the parts that are done.

The refactor remains provider-neutral and extension-first. Provider-specific
execution stays behind typed adapters, and capabilities that do not require
core lifecycle authority remain extensions rather than kernel responsibilities.

### Closeout is prepared, then settled

`prepareCloseout` verifies children, waivers, fresh evidence, required Human
Acceptance, remediation, lease/fencing, and source ownership, then persists an
immutable Closeout Plan while work remains active.

`settleCloseout` performs required host effects using durable effect IDs and
records idempotent Settlement Receipts. Required source commit, worktree, and
merge-safety effects settle before the transaction that marks work complete
and unlocks dependencies. Notifications, metrics, indexing, memory extraction,
presentation, and projection rendering are noncritical follow-on effects.

Closeout reports typed failures to Route; it contains no private retry policy.

### Automation-first verification and recovery

Every Technical Verdict references fresh immutable Verification Evidence with
criterion, work and Attempt identity, exact command/tool and working directory,
timestamps, exit code, source and database revisions, content hashes, durable
output reference, and environment metadata. Missing, stale, malformed, or
inconclusive evidence is never a pass.

Machine-fixable failures create or reuse linked Remediation Tasks. Recovery
chooses exactly one of `retry`, `repair`, `replan`, `remediate`, `clarify`,
`pause`, or `abort`, using persisted bounded budgets and normalized failure
fingerprints. Unrelated ready branches continue.

Human input blocks only the affected dependency and only for:

- missing authority, credential, account access, or external dependency;
- consent for destructive, irreversible, paid, public, or account-level work;
- materially ambiguous product intent with multiple valid routes;
- explicitly required Subjective UAT that tools cannot observe; or
- a user-defined time, cost, privacy, or policy limit.

Failed tests, projection failures, ordinary defects, worktree repair, stale
workers, missing harnesses, browser startup, and git conflicts are not
human-only by default.

## Invariants

1. The project database is the only normal-runtime Workflow Authority.
2. Files never mutate authority except through explicit, authorized import.
3. Every cross-transport mutation is revision-checked, fenced, and idempotent.
4. At most one active Attempt exists per work item; parallel work uses separate
   claims.
5. Attempt, question, decision, evidence, recovery, and closeout progress
   survives restart.
6. Failure, cancellation, timeout, projection state, or artifact presence can
   never fabricate completion.
7. Required evidence and settlement receipts exist before dependency unlock.
8. Projection failure is observable and repairable but non-authoritative.
9. Only the approved human-only taxonomy may pause for a person.
10. Legacy adapters translate into Domain Operations and Kernel Outcomes; they
    contain no independent policy or authority.

## Ownership

| Concern | Owner |
|---|---|
| Lifecycle sequencing, claims, stages, fencing, normalized outcomes | Lifecycle Kernel |
| Workflow mutations, revisions, journal/outbox, Projection Work | Single Writer / Domain Operations |
| Questions, answers, Decisions, corrections, checkpoints | Conversation domain module |
| Verification execution and evidence capture | Verification runners |
| Failure classification and bounded action selection | Recovery Classifier |
| Source isolation, commit, worktree, merge, publication mechanics | Git/worktree/publication modules |
| Rendering, retries, staleness, and rebuild | Projection worker |
| Provider execution, custom definitions, and transport behavior | Typed kernel adapters |

## Migration and cutover

Migration is additive and never runs two authorities.

1. Land characterization and fault-injection baselines before changing schema
   or routing.
2. Add revision/Authority Epoch, lifecycle and Attempt journal, stage
   checkpoints, questions/decisions/checkpoints, blockers/waivers, recovery,
   evidence/UAT, Projection Work, import/provenance, closeout/receipts, and
   custom-definition storage.
3. Backfill in one verified transaction. Preserve raw legacy values; map
   `skipped` only to cancellation and a provable Waiver; convert fabricated
   completion to failed/interrupted work with remediation (superseded by the
   2026-10-03 note below); treat unreliable assessment history as unverified.

   > **Note (2026-10-03):** the owner-decision default, as implemented by
   > `lifecycle.backfill`, replaces "failed/interrupted work with remediation".
   > A legacy completion with `completed_at`, a summary and a verification
   > result that is not failed is adopted as completed with an
   > `unverified-legacy` evidence marker. Every other legacy completion is
   > adopted as open work (`ready` or `pending`) and reported as a finding,
   > except under a parent already adopted as completed, where it stays
   > completed as unverified legacy and is reported as a finding.
   > The per-item-kind evidence rule lives in
   > `src/resources/extensions/gsd/lifecycle-backfill-domain-operation.ts`.
4. Route one low-risk work family through the kernel, then auto, interactive,
   standard, custom, and parallel families with semantic shadow comparison.
   Shadow comparison observes outcomes; it never creates disk authority.
5. Increment the per-Project Authority Epoch at cutover. A migrated Project
   cannot downgrade to disk authority.

   > **Note (2026-10-04):** owner decision: the cutover is automatic. The first
   > open of an existing project database at Authority Epoch 0 writes a
   > verified backup, runs `lifecycle.backfill`, and advances the epoch with
   > the `authority.cutover` Domain Operation. The precondition is a lifecycle
   > row for every milestone, slice and task, and idle coordination. It no
   > longer requires an Import Application as the operation head. The run is
   > the default; `GSD_AUTHORITY_CUTOVER=0` is the opt-out, kept for one
   > release. `CONTEXT.md` (State layer) owns the rest of the contract: when
   > the run stops or waits. The code is
   > `src/resources/extensions/gsd/authority-cutover-on-open.ts`.
   >
   > **Note (2026-10-04, older copy of the database file):** a process that
   > holds a receipt of a Domain Operation above Authority Epoch 0 refuses to
   > open the same Project at a lower epoch. `/gsd db restore-backup` refuses a
   > backup from a lower epoch. A new process that opens a file copy of a
   > database from before the cutover is outside this guarantee: nothing
   > outside the database file records the epoch. That copy holds no accepted
   > work from after the cutover. When the automatic cutover is on, the open
   > backs the copy up, backfills it and cuts it over again, so it does not
   > stay on legacy authority. A record of the highest epoch beside the
   > database file was considered and not built: it would refuse a file that
   > the automatic cutover can bring forward, and it cannot see an older copy
   > at the same epoch.
6. Roll out through development corpus, opt-in canary, and stable release gates
   with restart, fault, import, restore, parity, projection, and performance
   evidence.
7. Restore the exact verified pre-import backup only while its Import
   Application remains the canonical operation head, project revision and
   Authority Epoch still equal the Application result, no later canonical
   Domain Operation or cutover has committed, and explicit destructive consent
   is current. Any later Domain Operation or cutover permanently closes that
   restore window, even when later state equals the Application result. A
   difference review informs consent while the window is open and scopes
   Forward Repair after closure; it never reopens restore eligibility. After
   closure, Forward Repair is mandatory. Never roll back to disk authority.
8. Delete legacy paths only after their replacements, fault and restore gates,
   production routing closure, structural no-authority-read tests, telemetry
   thresholds, and performance baselines pass.

Explicit legacy import/export compatibility remains for two stable releases
and at least 60 days, whichever is longer, beginning when Import Preview and
Import Application ship. Time alone is not a Removal Gate. Backups remain
available through that window and at least one later stable release.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Restart and transport changes cannot change the authoritative next work.
- Discovery can span weeks without a parallel interview state machine.
- Automated evidence and remediation replace routine approval pauses.
- Projection drift becomes an operational concern, not lifecycle truth.
- One sequencer and shared closeout eliminate duplicated policy paths.
- Legacy complexity has explicit deletion gates and a bounded lifetime.

### Negative

- The additive schema and backfill are substantial and need corpus-based
  migration testing.
- Adapters temporarily increase code during the strangler migration.
- Durable evidence, effects, and projection queues add database volume and
  operational surfaces.
- Existing tests coupled to legacy internals must be rewritten around public
  Domain Operations and Kernel Outcomes before deletion.

## Alternatives considered

- **Keep database/filesystem reconciliation bidirectional.** Rejected because
  two authorities make drift unavoidable and recovery ambiguous.
- **Rewrite the workflow in one release.** Rejected because migration,
  restart, provider, git, and compatibility risk cannot be characterized or
  rolled out safely as a big bang.
- **Add another coordinator above existing loops.** Rejected because it
  preserves competing progression and closeout decisions.
- **Keep discovery as an interview-specific subsystem.** Rejected because it
  would need duplicate persistence, resume, dependency, and completion rules.
- **Ask the user to approve every phase or failure.** Rejected because tools
  should resolve observable work and routine defects autonomously.
- **Use process-local dirty projection tracking.** Rejected because projection
  intent and retries must survive process failure and commit atomically with
  the domain change.

## Existing ADR disposition

These dispositions define the accepted post-cutover architecture. They do not
claim that current runtime behavior has changed before the corresponding
migration and cutover gates complete.

The "Current effect" column records which dispositions are true in the runtime
now. It was assessed against `main` at `f083599c4`. "Not assessed" means that
no evidence was collected; it is not a claim in either direction. Update the
column when a migration gate passes.

| Existing decision | Disposition under ADR-046 | Current effect (2026-10-02) |
|---|---|---|
| ADR-003 Pipeline Simplification | Superseded before adoption. Research remains first-class, resumable Milestone work rather than being merged into planning or reduced to optional artifacts; its ceremony-reduction goal remains valid through the shared Lifecycle Kernel, automated verification, and durable closeout. | Partly. ADR-003 was not adopted. The shared Lifecycle Kernel and durable closeout are not complete. |
| ADR-009 Unified Orchestration Kernel | Superseded for workflow orchestration. Provider/model/TOS policy remains independently valid. | Not assessed. |
| ADR-011 Progressive Planning and Escalation | Progressive refinement retained; file-backed escalation, DAG, broad pauses, and forward-only correction superseded. | Partly. A Task escalation is an Open Question with a choice interaction and an Answer in the database (`escalation.ts`); no escalation file is written. Only a Task with a canonical lifecycle can escalate. DAG, broad pauses, and forward-only correction are not yet replaced. |
| ADR-013 Memory Store Consolidation | Amended. `memories` remains canonical for reusable cross-session knowledge, while workflow Decisions and their lifecycle effects move to the Conversation domain; memory extraction is noncritical follow-on work. KNOWLEDGE.md Rules are `memories` rows (`category = rule`, `sourceKnowledgeId` K###); this supersedes ADR-013's file-owned Rules. Global knowledge (`~/.gsd/agent/KNOWLEDGE.md`) and the pi-coding-agent memory extension (`~/.gsd/agent/agent.db`) are user-level stores outside project authority: they are not project database content, not imported, and not rendered. gsd-pi does not load that extension: it is not a bundled resource and no extension discovery path includes it, so it does not run beside the gsd extension. | Not yet. Workflow Decisions are still `memories` rows. The Conversation domain is not in production. |
| ADR-014 Auto Orchestration Deep Module | Amended and generalized into the shared Lifecycle Kernel. | Not yet. The Lifecycle Kernel is not the sole sequencer for every unit type and entry point. |
| ADR-015 Runtime Invariant Modules | Retained with database-only reconciliation and typed module results. | Partly. The modules are retained. Reconciliation still compares projection files. |
| ADR-016 Worktree Lifecycle and Projection | Worktree Lifecycle retained; workflow-state copying and worktree-local authority reconciliation superseded. | Partly. Worktree Lifecycle is in effect. `worktree-state-projection.ts` still copies workflow files to worktrees. |
| ADR-016 Worktree Safety | Retained. | In effect. |
| ADR-016 Phase 2 Design Notes | Historical implementation addendum. | In effect (historical record). |
| ADR-017 Drift-Driven State Reconciliation | Superseded; only idempotent database-invariant repair remains. | Not yet. `reconcileBeforeDispatch` is in production and projection drift can still block dispatch. |
| ADR-018 PROJECT Authority Contract | Retained and generalized to all workflow artifacts; prose cannot register machine facts implicitly. | Partly. In effect for PROJECT. KNOWLEDGE.md Rules, Patterns and Lessons are written as DB rows and KNOWLEDGE.md is rendered from them. Session start no longer imports KNOWLEDGE.md rows into the database, and prompt inlines, the visualizer, `gsd_knowledge` and the web Knowledge view read the database, not the file. `/gsd recover` imports KNOWLEDGE.md Rule, Pattern and Lesson rows through an Import Preview and Import Application; the Preview reports every other part of the file as not imported. A file row that differs from its active database row is reported as a conflict and the database row is kept; the file text replaces it only by an explicit `--choice=<id>.use-file` in a new sealed Preview, and Forward Repair can restore the earlier database row. File rows that are not imported yet, and file content the import does not model, are still kept in the render and shown by those readers. An on-disk CONTEXT.md still enters state from files. |
| ADR-022 Post-Unit Gate Enforcement | Amended: the shared kernel owns progression; remediation replaces routine pauses. | Not yet. See ADR-014. |
| ADR-023 Hook Outcome Frontmatter | Superseded by database Verification Evidence and Technical Verdicts. | Not yet. Hook verdicts are still read from artifact files. |
| ADR-025 Closeout Consistency Gate | Retained and generalized by prepared/settled closeout and receipts. | Partly. The gate is retained. `prepareCloseout` and `settleCloseout` exist for a Milestone whose work is on a milestone branch; the gate accepts that open Milestone once its Closeout Plan is stored. A Task closes out through its own Closeout Plan whose source commit is effect ordinal 1 ([ADR-050](ADR-050-task-and-slice-closeout-receipts.md)); a Slice has no plan row, and `slice.complete` cites the tested source set hash and its Tasks' receipts. |
| ADR-028/029 Preload-Authoritative Guidance | Grounded-context discipline retained; workflow context must derive from one database snapshot. | Partly. The discipline is in effect. Workflow context still reads some projection files. |
| ADR-030 Two-Altitude State Machine | Single Writer chokepoint retained; in-memory phase authority, skipped status, and filesystem replay superseded. | Partly. The Single Writer chokepoint is in effect. The `skipped` status still exists. |
| ADR-032 Unit Closeout Module | Superseded by `prepareCloseout` plus `settleCloseout`. | Partly. `prepareCloseout` and `settleCloseout` close out a Milestone that has a milestone branch, and a Task's closeout is a plan whose source commit settles before publication ([ADR-050](ADR-050-task-and-slice-closeout-receipts.md)). `unit-closeout.ts` is still in production for the interactive commit; a Slice has no plan row. |
| ADR-033 Unit Registry | Retained as adapter/tool/prompt metadata only. | Not assessed. |
| ADR-034 Merge and Publication Split | Retained; required source effects precede completion and publication remains non-authoritative. | Partly. The split is retained. For an adopted Milestone with a milestone branch, the merge is a required Closeout Effect that settles before completion, and the push is a non-required effect that the next closeout retries. The GitHub milestone close is a non-required effect that runs only after the Milestone is completed. A Milestone closed out on a validation Waiver uses the same plan: the plan cites the newest settled validation Attempt, and when validation never ran, the Attempt that the Waiver settled as interrupted. For an adopted Task, the source commit is a required Closeout Effect of the Task Closeout Plan and publication waits for its Settlement Receipt ([ADR-050](ADR-050-task-and-slice-closeout-receipts.md)); an unadopted Task still uses the old order, and the draft PR is unchanged (`closeout-effects`, `merge-publication-settlement`). |
| ADR-035 Dirty Projection Scope | Superseded before adoption by durable Projection Work. | Partly. The Projection Worker delivers durable Projection Work per row through a kind-to-renderer registry, with retry and `dead_letter`. Each kind that production code enqueues has a renderer; a row of any other kind stays pending and visible. |
| ADR-038 Dispatch History Module | Superseded by persisted Attempts, Failure Observations, fingerprints, and recovery budgets. | In effect through [ADR-047](ADR-047-auto-mode-liveness-backstop.md), which deleted the dispatch-history module. |
| ADR-039 Consent Question Module | Superseded by explicit interaction kinds and the narrow consent boundary. | Partly. An answered `ask_user_questions` round of a Milestone discussion is stored as Open Question, interaction and Answer rows with an explicit interaction kind: `consent` for a gate question, `choice` for any other. A round outside a Milestone discussion, a question with more than three options, and an unanswered round are not stored as rows. `consent-question.ts` is in production and still decides the pause and the answer policy. |
| ADR-040 Write-Gate Snapshot Adapters | Superseded by Domain Operations, revisions, fencing, and Authority Epoch. | Partly. The snapshot file and its two-process merge are deleted: write-gate state is `write_gate_state` rows that the host and the workflow MCP child read through one reader, and a verified gate survives a restart. The rows are enforcement rows written outside Domain Operations and do not read the Authority Epoch. The Authority Epoch advances on the first open of an existing database (unless `GSD_AUTHORITY_CUTOVER=0`). A gate question answered in a Milestone discussion and its answer are a consent interaction row and an Answer row; the gate itself is still enforced from the `write_gate_state` rows. A gate question with no Milestone lifecycle (PROJECT, REQUIREMENTS) has no interaction row. |
| ADR-041 Engine Hook Contract | Retained; hooks submit typed adapter results and cannot own lifecycle. | Not assessed. |
| ADR-042 Three Session Types | Session separation retained; durable GSD lifecycle moves out of AutoSession. | Not assessed. |
| ADR-045 Flat-Phase Migration | Amended: superseded for startup layout detection and automatic filesystem migration; legacy layouts are explicit import/export formats, not startup authority. Flat-phase projection layout work continues. | Partly. Flat-phase layout work continues (see the amendment below). The read cutover that removes on-disk layout from runtime decisions is open. |

Each superseded or amended ADR has a short top-of-file status notice linking
here. Historical bodies remain intact.

**Amendment (2026-10-05), ADR-050:** the Current effect of ADR-025, ADR-032
and ADR-034 was reassessed against the Task and Slice closeout receipts: a
Task publishes only when its source commit has a Settlement Receipt, and
`slice.complete` requires every Task of the Slice to be published. See
[ADR-050](ADR-050-task-and-slice-closeout-receipts.md).

**Amendment (2026-10-02), ADR-045:** flat-phase layout work continues. ADR-045
is superseded only where it gives an on-disk layout runtime authority: startup
layout detection and automatic filesystem migration. Its projection work
(single-sourced layout resolution for renders, and stale-render detection as a
diagnostic) stays valid and is not blocked by this ADR.

## Implementation boundary and references

Acceptance of this ADR authorizes planning and implementation in the approved
dependency order; it does not waive normal review, testing, migration, or
release gates. Work must first be created as database-backed Milestones,
Slices, Tasks, dependencies, and acceptance contracts. Markdown plans are
rendered review surfaces only.

Implementation follows the twelve-Milestone program in the linked
decomposition. Each Task is a focused reviewable change, characterizes behavior
before replacing a path, uses targeted intent-verifying tests, runs code
simplification after code changes, and reaches green CI before dependent work
advances.
