# Architecture Overview

GSD is a TypeScript application built on the [Pi SDK](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono). It embeds the Pi coding agent and extends it with the GSD workflow engine, auto mode state machine, and project management primitives.

## Key Design Decisions

### DB-Authoritative Project State

GSD stores runtime workflow state in the project-root SQLite database. Auto mode derives phases, completion status, requirements, decisions, summaries, and hierarchy from that database, then renders markdown projections in `.gsd/` for human review, prompt context, and git-friendly history. No in-memory state survives across sessions. This enables crash recovery, multi-terminal steering, and session resumption while avoiding silent markdown re-imports during normal runtime.

#### Evidence-gated lifecycle shadow repair

Projects that crossed the canonical-lifecycle cutover can be partially adopted: the Milestone has a `workflow_item_lifecycles` row while older, already-complete Tasks or Slices only have legacy hierarchy status. A closeout must not trust that status alone, but it also must not leave a project permanently blocked with `missing canonical lifecycle authority` when durable completion evidence exists.

Before an adopted Milestone records a new validation receipt, validation runs a narrow forward repair over its descendants. The repair:

- accepts only legacy-complete items with a completion timestamp and durable summary evidence;
- additionally requires a passing verification result for Tasks;
- repairs Tasks before Slices so authority converges from the leaves upward;
- records every transition through the replay-safe `lifecycle.shadow.repair` Domain Operation;
- reports unsupported or conflicting shadows instead of forcing them, including a legacy-complete item with no lifecycle row and no durable evidence; and
- leaves the strict Milestone completion guard unchanged.

No completion adopts a row on legacy status alone. Slice completion, Milestone validation, and Milestone completion refuse a descendant with no lifecycle row. The `lifecycle.backfill` Domain Operation (`lifecycle-backfill-domain-operation.ts`, run by `/gsd db adopt --apply`) is the one path that adopts every such row. The first open of an existing database at Authority Epoch 0 runs it and then advances the Authority Epoch (`authority-cutover-on-open.ts`), unless the environment variable `GSD_AUTHORITY_CUTOVER=0` is set. `CONTEXT.md` (State layer) owns that contract: when the run stops or waits, and the opt-out. `/gsd db adopt --apply` runs the backfill by hand. See [`/gsd db adopt`](../user-docs/commands.md) for its rules.

An Import Application adopts only the rows in its sealed Preview. A row it adopts as cancelled (legacy `skipped`, `deferred` or `cancelled`) gets the same legacy-attested Waiver as the backfill, so Slice closeout, Milestone closeout and reopen accept it. Import is one of the two documented exceptions to 'one event per item' (the Forward Repair below is the other): an Import Application records one event for the whole import, so each import Waiver keeps the raw legacy status and the rule used in its rationale. A lifecycle row that an earlier build adopted as cancelled with no Waiver gets its legacy-attested Waiver, and one event, from the next `lifecycle.backfill` run. A slice imported as completed gets no Q8 quality gate row, because the import has no gate evidence; an open imported slice gets a pending one. The import still adopts a completion from the legacy source without the backfill's evidence rule: an imported markdown `done` stays completed as unverified legacy. The import itself stores no `unverified-legacy` token, because it has no per-item event. The next `lifecycle.backfill` run stores it: one `lifecycle.backfilled` event for each such row, with the raw legacy status, rule `import-adopted-completion` and evidence `unverified-legacy`. The lifecycle row does not change. `/gsd db adopt --apply` runs it, and so does the automatic backfill at Authority Epoch 0. Neither stores a marker while the Restore Window of the import is open and the markers are the only pending work: marker bookkeeping never closes a Restore Window. After the Restore Window closes, the next run stores them; after the Cutover an open runs the backfill only for rows that have no lifecycle row. The provenance of the lifecycle row is what closeout reads: status `completed` at state version 0, with the `import.apply` operation as its last operation. The import writes no Attempt, verdict, verification evidence or gate run for such a row. Verification evidence is required only for new work. Slice closeout accepts a Task with that provenance and no completion proof. It accepts a Task that `lifecycle.backfill` adopted as completed (rule `legacy-complete-evidenced` or `legacy-complete-under-completed-parent`) the same way: status `completed` at state version 0, with the `lifecycle.backfill` operation as its last operation. Slice closeout still refuses every other completed Task that has no current passing Technical Verdict and verification evidence. Milestone closeout demands no completion proof for a completed Slice or Task. After the Cutover, a Forward Repair that puts back a hierarchy row that an Import Application deleted adopts the row in its own `import.forward_repair` Domain Operation, with the rules of the backfill and no event per item; an unknown legacy status refuses the repair. At Authority Epoch 0 the repair adopts the row only when the adoption keeps its legacy status: a row whose adoption would change its legacy status, or whose status is unknown, stays with no lifecycle row, and the next automatic Cutover stops and names it (`CONTEXT.md`, State layer). Closeout accepts its legacy-attested Waiver and its unverified-legacy completion the same way as those of an Import Application.

A row that is still open under a Milestone or Slice already adopted as completed is adopted by the backfill as cancelled with a legacy-attested Waiver, and the backfill report lists it. A row there whose legacy status is a completion with no evidence stays completed as unverified legacy (rule `legacy-complete-under-completed-parent`), with a finding in the report; it never becomes cancelled.

Repair happens before validation, not during completion. Descendant lifecycle writes intentionally make older validation receipts stale, so the new pass receipt must be recorded after repair. If a project already has a pass receipt from before this repair, rerun Milestone validation once; do not edit SQLite or lifecycle projections manually.

Milestone queue position is `milestones.sequence`, written by the `milestone.reorder` Domain Operation; `.gsd/QUEUE-ORDER.json` is its render. State derivation never reads that file into the database; the [DB map](../db-map.md) owns the details. All generated `.gsd` artifacts are projections unless an explicit import or recovery command reads them.

`db/domain-operation.ts` is the authoritative write seam for milestone, slice, and task planning, task and slice replanning, roadmap reassessment, task execution Attempts, Task recovery routing, host Technical Verdicts, verified Task publication, Slice complete/cancel/reopen/reset, Task cancel through `/gsd skip`, and Milestone park/unpark/discard/reorder. `executeDomainOperation()` owns a `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction that revision- and Authority-Epoch-checks a request, reserves a project-scoped idempotency key, records provenance and ordered events, enqueues their outbox destinations and Projection Work, then advances authority with a compare-and-swap. Exact retries return the durable receipt without rerunning the mutation. `planning-domain-operation.ts` and `slice-lifecycle-domain-operation.ts` compose those guarantees with legacy hierarchy writes and lifecycle shadow comparison; `planning-invocation.ts` and `execution-invocation.ts` supply transport-stable private identity for Pi, internal auto-mode, and workflow MCP calls. Planning adopts canonical lifecycle heads while preserving the legacy public response contract, and removed pending work is retained as legacy `skipped` / canonical `cancelled` until explicitly reopened. Cleanup removes a stale PLAN file only when its current content still matches the writer-owned compatibility marker or PLAN artifact, preserving user-modified files. Execute-task units claim a canonical Attempt, settle exactly one immutable Result, route failures through bounded immutable Recovery Actions, record host verification evidence before publication, and publish completion only after a passing Technical Verdict for the current source revision. Slice operations validate the entire descendant hierarchy and commit one atomic cascade without erasing immutable execution history. Compatibility JSONL and Markdown are emitted after commit and cannot authorize lifecycle transitions; public callers preserve stale and duplicate projection diagnostics so a missing readable artifact cannot masquerade as a failed or fresh mutation. A resolved or dismissed user/external Blocker can continue only by being superseded by an agent-owned recovery route and a fresh lineage-linked Attempt. Milestone lifecycle commands, standalone UAT authority, and broader lifecycle routing have not fully cut over yet; the current schema version is owned by `SCHEMA_VERSION` in `db/engine.ts`, and Markdown remains projection output rather than workflow authority.

Historical Slice lifecycle replays additionally surface `superseded` with
`duplicate`; they never use current-success wording or repair a newer
projection.

### Semantic Shadow Evidence and Cutover Boundary

Milestone status remains a legacy-response read during M003. The shared status
executor reads legacy hierarchy and canonical lifecycle state in one read
transaction, compares them with the frozen lifecycle vocabulary, and emits a
response-neutral observation after the read. Native Pi captures the exact
project source revision lazily on the first status call in a turn and reuses it
for later status calls in that turn. The Claude workflow-MCP pump carries a
private token, captures the source revision lazily on its first status call,
and reuses that revision for later status calls in the pump. Capture or sink
failure never changes the public response, but it produces explicit, durable
loss accounting. No public tool argument or environment-provided hash can
supply source authority.

The S07 cutover dossier is a deterministic projection over two intentionally
different inputs: disposable `capstone_fixture` coverage and read-only
`live_project` database history. Random fixture identifiers are discarded when
the collector emits its normalized UAT artifact and appear only as stable
presence facts in the checked report. Exact live-project lifecycle identifiers
remain in the canonical-history plane. The report includes exact
mode/transport/classification counts, public-response and
capstone hashes, scoped repair lineage, live drift, compatibility witnesses,
the no-cutover gate, and the 4/4 authority baseline. It cannot authorize a
transition, repair state, or turn fixture coverage into production telemetry.

Candidate evidence names the exact source tree exercised before the generated
JSON exists. Post-generation checks and `verify:merge` are persisted through
database-backed UAT. The final source-bound Technical Verdict is created only
after rerunning the capstone from the exact merged commit; that database receipt
binds the merge commit, source-content revision, dossier hash, capstone hash,
and durable evidence. This two-phase protocol avoids a self-referential source
hash. S07 therefore proves convergence while remaining `NO_GO` for canonical
read authority until the explicitly deferred compatibility and lifecycle
surfaces are implemented and separately approved.

### Two-File Loader Pattern

`loader.ts` sets all environment variables with zero SDK imports, then dynamically imports `cli.ts` which does static SDK imports. This ensures `PI_PACKAGE_DIR` is set before any SDK code evaluates.

### `pkg/` Shim Directory

`PI_PACKAGE_DIR` points to `pkg/` (not project root) to avoid Pi's theme resolution colliding with GSD's `src/` directory. Contains only `piConfig` and theme assets.

### Managed Resource Sync

Bundled extensions, shared files, agents, and skills are synced to
`~/.gsd/agent/` on launch when the managed-resource manifest or content
fingerprint is stale. The `gsd-browser` skill is then overlaid from the
installed `@opengsd/gsd-browser` package, including package-relative support
files, so browser automation guidance tracks the browser package instead of a
duplicated Pi copy.

### Lazy Provider Loading

LLM provider SDKs (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, etc.) are lazy-loaded on first use rather than imported at startup. This significantly reduces cold-start time — only the provider you actually connect to gets loaded.

### Fresh Session Per Unit

Every dispatch creates a new agent session. The LLM starts with a clean context window containing only the pre-inlined artifacts it needs. This prevents quality degradation from context accumulation.

### Workspace Roots, Not Ambient `cwd`

GSD workflow code must treat the active project/worktree as explicit state, not infer it from ambient `process.cwd()`. Prefer `AutoSession.scope`, `s.canonicalProjectRoot`, `s.basePath`, `s.originalBasePath`, hook `ctx.cwd`, or an explicit `basePath` parameter depending on the boundary. `cwd` remains valid as a subprocess/shell option in generic Pi tooling, but GSD identity, DB paths, workflow gates, auto-mode sessions, and dynamic tool execution should be rooted from explicit workflow state.

## Dispatch Pipeline

The auto-loop is a **linear** pipeline (`auto/loop.ts`), the replacement for the older recursive `dispatchNextUnit → resolveAgentEnd → dispatchNextUnit` chain. Each iteration flows through explicit stages (see [auto-mode.md](../user-docs/auto-mode.md) for the full description):

```
1. Pre-Dispatch  — derive state, run UOK guards, resolve model preferences, check captures
2. Dispatch      — build the prompt and execute the unit with the selected model
3. Post-Unit     — close out the unit, snapshot metrics, verify artifacts, persist state
4. Finalize      — milestone/slice completion and projection
5. Loop          — advance to the next unit
```

Model routing (complexity classification, budget pressure, routing history, capability scoring) is folded into the Pre-Dispatch stage via `auto-model-selection.ts` (`selectAndApplyModel`), not handled as standalone pipeline steps. Phase skipping (from a token profile) gates which unit types are dispatched.

## Key Modules

> The auto-mode kernel lives under the `auto/` subdirectory (`auto/orchestrator.ts`, `auto/loop.ts`, `auto/phases.ts`, `auto/dispatch.ts`, `auto/finalize.ts`, `auto/dispatch-key.ts`, and `workflow-kernel.ts`). Pre-dispatch invariants are enforced by the `uok/` deep module (`uok/flags.ts`, `uok/gate-runner.ts`) wired into the orchestrator. The flat `auto-*.ts` modules below are the older, surrounding surface.
