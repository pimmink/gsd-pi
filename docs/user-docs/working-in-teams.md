# Working in Teams

GSD supports multi-user workflows where several developers work on the same repository concurrently.

## Setup

### 1. Set Team Mode

The simplest way to configure GSD for team use is to set `mode: team` in your project preferences. This enables unique milestone IDs, push branches, and pre-merge checks in one setting:

```yaml
# .gsd/PREFERENCES.md (project-level, committed to git)
---
version: 1
mode: team
---
```

This is equivalent to manually setting `unique_milestone_ids: true`, `git.push_branches: true`, `git.pre_merge_check: true`, and other team-appropriate defaults. You can still override individual settings — for example, adding `git.auto_push: true` on top of `mode: team` if your team prefers auto-push.

Alternatively, you can configure each setting individually without using a mode (see [Git Strategy](git-strategy.md) for details).

### 2. Know What Is Shared

The workflow database (`gsd.db`) is the only authority for milestones, slices, tasks, decisions, and requirements. It is never committed. Every checkout has its own database:

- The database records the checkout root it belongs to. A second clone that resolves to the same state directory (for example two clones of one remote on one machine) is refused with `checkout-unbound`. Give the second clone its own state with `GSD_PROJECT_ID`, or, when the old checkout was moved or deleted, run `/gsd db bind` in the new one.
- A `gsd.db` copied from another checkout is refused the same way.

Markdown under `.gsd/` (PROJECT.md, REQUIREMENTS.md, DECISIONS.md, `phases/`, `milestones/`) is a projection of the database: an export for reading and review, not shared authority. By default `.gsd` lives outside the repository and is ignored, so nothing is committed.

If your team commits the `.gsd/` markdown (a real `.gsd/` directory with tracked files), GSD keeps its runtime files out of git for you: it adds them to `.gitignore` and leaves them out of its own commits. This includes the database, the render baseline `.gsd/.compat.json`, and `.gsd/quarantine/`.

### 3. Commit the Preferences

```bash
git add .gsd/PREFERENCES.md
git commit -m "chore: enable GSD team workflow"
```

## Importing Committed Planning Changes

Committed markdown enters your database only through an explicit import:

- **Fresh clone.** A clone that has tracked `.gsd/` milestone markdown and no database, or an empty one, is refused with `authority-missing` in auto, guided, headless, and MCP writes. The same applies to a clone that has only a tracked `PROJECT.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, or `REQUIREMENTS.md` and a database with no workflow rows. Run `/gsd recover` to review the Import Preview and apply it. GSD never starts an empty database beside these projections on its own. To start without the earlier history on purpose, run `/gsd db start-empty`: the choice is stored in the database, and no file is changed. A milestone directory that the database does not know still stops dispatch until you delete it, rename it, or import it.
- **Pull, merge, rebase, or branch switch.** When a tracked projection changes outside GSD, auto mode, guided flow, and `/gsd dispatch` stop before the next dispatch with one "Projection files changed outside GSD" message. Choose one:
  - keep the change: review it, then run `/gsd recover` to import it through Import Preview;
  - discard the change: run `/gsd rebuild markdown`. The changed bytes are kept under `.gsd/quarantine/`.

No dispatch runs on the old database content until you choose.

## Migrating an Existing Project

If you have an existing project with `.gsd/` blanket-ignored:

1. Ensure no milestones are in progress (clean state)
2. Stop ignoring the `.gsd/` markdown you want to share; GSD keeps its runtime files ignored
3. Add `unique_milestone_ids: true` to `.gsd/PREFERENCES.md`
4. Optionally rename existing milestones to use unique IDs:

   ```
   I have turned on unique milestone ids, please update all old milestone
   ids to use this new format e.g. M001-abc123 where abc123 is a random
   6 char lowercase alpha numeric string. Update all references in all
   .gsd file contents, file names and directory names. Validate your work
   once done to ensure referential integrity.
   ```

5. Commit

## Plan Review Workflow

Teams configured to track planning artifacts in git (i.e. with `mode: team` and `.gsd/phases/` not gitignored) can use a two-PR cycle to get plan approval before any code is written:

1. **Plan PR** — developer runs `/gsd discuss` on `main`, which commits the plan to the project database and renders the flat-phase planning artifacts to `.gsd/phases/<NN-slug>/` (phase files `<NN>-CONTEXT.md` and `<NN>-ROADMAP.md`) plus the top-level `.gsd/REQUIREMENTS.md` and `.gsd/DECISIONS.md`; the rendered files are views of the database, and the PR carries those rendered views. Legacy projects may still resolve to `.gsd/milestones/<MID>/<MID>-*.md` until migration. The developer commits these and opens a docs-only PR.
2. **Review** — the team reviews scope, risks, slice breakdown, and definition of done directly in GitHub. No code to review yet, just the plan.
3. **Code PR** — after the plan PR is merged, the developer pulls `main`, imports the approved plan with `/gsd recover` (see [Importing Committed Planning Changes](#importing-committed-planning-changes)), and runs `/gsd auto`. GSD creates a worktree and executes against the imported plan. The result is a second PR with the actual implementation.

`/gsd discuss` does not auto-commit — the developer controls when and how planning artifacts are committed.

### What reviewers should look for

- **`<NN>-CONTEXT.md`** — is the scope well-defined? Are constraints and non-goals clear?
- **`<NN>-ROADMAP.md`** — does the slice breakdown make sense? Are slices ordered by dependency?
- **`.gsd/DECISIONS.md`** — are the architectural choices justified?

### Steering during execution

`/gsd steer` records the override in the project database, which the project root and every worktree share. `.gsd/OVERRIDES.md` is rendered from the database. Edits to an override that GSD rendered are not read back. An override block that the database does not hold (written by an older release, by hand, or committed by a teammate) stays in the file but is not active: `/gsd doctor` reports it, and `/gsd doctor --fix` imports it. The override does not modify the approved plan docs on `main`; the plan changes that the rewrite unit makes appear in the code PR diff alongside the implementation.

### Automated gates

For teams that want a required discussion checkpoint before each slice (not just the milestone), add `require_slice_discussion: true` to preferences:

```yaml
phases:
  require_slice_discussion: true
```

This pauses auto-mode when a slice is missing its slice `CONTEXT` file and requires the developer to run `/gsd discuss` for that slice before proceeding.

## Parallel Development

Multiple developers can run auto mode simultaneously on different milestones. Each developer:

- Gets their own worktree (`.gsd-worktrees/<MID>/`, gitignored)
- Works on a unique `milestone/<MID>` branch
- Squash-merges to main independently

Milestone dependencies can be declared in the phase context frontmatter:

```yaml
---
depends_on: [M001-eh88as]
---
```

GSD enforces that dependent milestones complete before starting downstream work.
