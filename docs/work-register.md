# Contributor Work Register

Human-readable projection of [`work-register.json`](./work-register.json), which is the
canonical source. GitHub and local Git evidence was refreshed on **2026-08-21**.

- **Upstream / PR required**: intended for contribution to `open-gsd/gsd-pi`.
- **Fork-local / No PR planned**: tooling, recovery, or workflow used only by this fork;
  it must not be added to an upstream feature PR.
- **Historical**: completed or closed upstream work retained for traceability.

## Active work

| ID | Work | Scope | Upstream | Issue | PR | Branch | Status | Next action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GSD-W013 | Fork-native VS Code and Copilot workspace | Fork-local | No PR planned | — | — | `docs/copilot-workspace-governance` | Complete | Maintain profile/templates/register from governance anchor; keep feature worktrees clean |
| GSD-W014 | GitHub Copilot model-catalog sync (`/gsd copilot-models`) | Upstream | PR required | — | — | `feat/github-copilot-model-catalog-sync` | Complete — rebased to `7a81883a1187c07a3ce7dfd770caf2c520e7173b` on current `upstream/main` `6a310619c187a3d940adc29e282c7d39246739b1`; exact-SHA remote full-gate run `32476902861` (`remote-full-gate.yml`) confirmed both `verify-pr (literal)` and `verify-merge (literal)` succeeded on this head. | No overlapping upstream issue or PR was found; use the prepared local issue/PR drafts and open the upstream contribution only after explicit GitHub-write authorization |
| GSD-W015 | Sharded remote pr-verification harness (test-efficiency) | Fork-local (lives in `pimmink/gsd-pi-ci`, not this repo) | No PR planned | — | — | `perf/unit-test-sharding` (gsd-pi-ci) | Complete | None required; optional future promotion from experimental to primary |
| GSD-W017 | Cheaper same-tier Copilot suggestions in `pricing`/`why` | Upstream | PR required | — | — | `feat/copilot-cheaper-model-suggestions` | In progress — separate follow-up branch based on W014 tip `7a81883a1187c07a3ce7dfd770caf2c520e7173b`; focused handler/cost-table suites, `typecheck:extensions`, and `verify:fast` are green. That `verify:fast` run used a symlinked dependency tree and recreated the source worktree `node_modules`, so treat it as local confidence rather than clean-runner submission evidence. | Decide whether to keep it upstream-scoped, then commit cleanly, satisfy issue-first policy if required, and prefer clean-runner remote verification before any PR |
| GSD-W018 | Session-start GitHub Copilot catalog refresh and runtime model activation | Upstream | PR required | — | — | `feat/copilot-catalog-session-refresh` | In progress — separate follow-up branch stacked on W014 tip `7a81883a1187c07a3ce7dfd770caf2c520e7173b`, head `693ebc5885ab70247099def1c2c42de53814bfd7`; 32 new tests and `typecheck:extensions` are green; exact-SHA remote full-gate run `32482885693` dispatched, result pending. | Await run `32482885693`; GSD-W017 is expected to rebase onto this branch once it reaches a stable SHA |

## Important commit references

- `7a81883a1187c07a3ce7dfd770caf2c520e7173b` — live W014 rebase onto current
  `upstream/main` `6a310619c187a3d940adc29e282c7d39246739b1`; local focused W014
  regression `209/209` and `typecheck:extensions` passed; fresh exact-SHA remote
  full-gate evidence is still pending.
- `6d0ccb73176841c927e5f16a34d73db0d97011f1` — historical W014 exact-SHA closeout
  on prior base `4bbfb31fa5f57bba8d977f4da2ee68ded56355ae`; remote full-gate
  `32309145810` proved literal `verify:pr` and `verify:merge`, now superseded by
  the newer rebase.
- `e8e46fe9450f326641fccf7bbf3929f10be80f09` — GSD-W016 recovery artifact for the
  stranded W014 Phase I/J economics and routing spike; provenance only, not
  directly mergeable.
- `a381d55`, `3667f8d`, `87648c0` — GSD-W015 sharded remote pr-verification
  harness in `pimmink/gsd-pi-ci`.

  recovery snapshot tracked by GSD-W012.

## Register maintenance

For every status change:

1. Confirm current GitHub state through GitHub MCP or a bounded `gh` read.
2. Confirm local and remote branch heads through Git.
3. Update `work-register.json` first.
4. Update this projection in the same commit.
5. Include validation evidence and one concrete next action.

Do not remove closed or superseded entries. They explain why branches and commits exist and
prevent repeated work.
