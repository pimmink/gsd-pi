# gsd-pi Prompt System Map

> Complete dependency graph of all prompts, how they're loaded, assembled, dispatched, and how they chain into each other.

## 2. Prompt Loading Infrastructure

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `prompt-loader.ts` | Reads all `prompts/*.md` at startup into `templateCache`. Substitutes `{{varName}}` placeholders. Falls back to lazy read if cache misses. Preloads `templatesDir`, `taskSummaryTemplatePath`, `skillActivation` as defaults. |
| `prompt-ordering.ts` | Splits assembled prompt into `## sections`, classifies each as `static / semi-static / dynamic`, reorders to maximize LLM cache prefix stability. |
| `prompt-validation.ts` | Validates that all `{{vars}}` declared in a template have values provided before substitution fires. |
| `prompt-cache-optimizer.ts` | Tracks cache hit/miss rates per prompt; adjusts section ordering hints over time. |

**Template resolution priority** (highest wins):

1. `~/.agents/gsd/prompts/` (user-local, written by `initResources()`)
2. Module-relative `prompts/` (npm package fallback)

---

## 3. Shared Injected Variables (every prompt gets these for free)

```
{{templatesDir}}              path to templates/ dir
{{planTemplatePath}}          templates/plan.md
{{taskPlanTemplatePath}}      templates/task-plan.md
{{taskSummaryTemplatePath}}   templates/task-summary.md
{{skillActivation}}           standard skill-loading instruction block
```

---

## 4. Context Composition Stack

Every `buildXxxPrompt()` call assembles context via these layers (in order):

```
Preamble  (system.md rules, skill activation block)
    │
Static section
    ├── PROJECT.md
    ├── REQUIREMENTS.md
    └── DECISIONS.md

Semi-static section
    ├── KNOWLEDGE.md  (Rules section only — patterns/lessons stripped; ADR-013 Stage 2c)
    ├── memories      (prompt-relevant patterns, gotchas, decisions — canonical for patterns/lessons)
    ├── PREFERENCES.md
    └── Prior slice/milestone RESEARCH.md

Dynamic section
    ├── Active NN-CONTEXT.md
    ├── Active NN-MM-PLAN.md (slice plan + embedded task planning)
    ├── Task summary from prior run (resume)
    ├── Carry-forward captures
    └── Gate list to close
```

Before this map is assembled, `buildBeforeAgentStartResult()` runs the
session-start KNOWLEDGE projection path and then calls
`loadKnowledgeBlock()`. Session start never imports `.gsd/KNOWLEDGE.md` into the
database. The helper inlines only the Rules section of the project knowledge,
read from the database; projected patterns and lessons are supplied through
the memories layer. A Pattern or Lesson that exists only in the file has no
memories row, so the helper inlines it too until `/gsd recover` imports it.

Budget enforcement: `context-budget.ts` computes `preambleBudgetChars`, `summaryBudgetChars`, `verificationBudgetChars` from the model's context window. Sections are truncated at markdown section boundaries, not mid-sentence.

### 4a. Tool Policy Modes

Auto-mode unit manifests declare a runtime-enforced `tools` policy. `write-gate.ts` checks the active unit before each tool call.

| Mode | Allowed surface |
|------|-----------------|
| `all` | Read, source writes, Bash, and subagents. Used by execution units that run in milestone worktrees. |
| `read-only` | Read tools only. No shell, writes, or subagents. |
| `planning` | Read tools, `.gsd/**` writes, and safe read-only Bash. No subagents. |
| `planning-dispatch` | Same as `planning`, plus subagents explicitly listed by the manifest. |
| `docs` | Same as `planning`, plus writes to configured documentation globs. No subagents. |
| `verification` | Read tools and Bash for build/test verification commands such as `npm run build`, `npm test`, `pnpm test`, `vitest`, `jest`, and `go test`; writes remain restricted to `.gsd/**`, and subagents are blocked. |

---

## 5. The 43 Prompt Files — Full Inventory

### 5a. System & Foundation

| Prompt | Purpose | Reads | Writes |
|--------|---------|-------|--------|
| `system.md` | Hard rules, isolation model, naming conventions, skills table, execution heuristics. Bundled into every prompt as preamble. | — | — |
| `heal-skill.md` | Post-unit skill drift analysis. Never edits skill files directly. | Skill activation block | `.gsd/skill-review-queue.md` |

### 5b. Project Setup Flow (runs once, sequentially)

```
guided-workflow-preferences
         │
         ▼
guided-discuss-project
         │
         ▼
guided-discuss-requirements
         │
         ▼
guided-research-project  (only when the recorded research decision is `research` — 4 parallel subagents)
```

| Prompt | Purpose | Key Tools Called |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| `guided-workflow-preferences.md` | Write `.gsd/PREFERENCES.md` with defaults. No user questions. | — |
| `guided-discuss-project.md` | Interview-style project scoping. Classifies project shape (tiny/small/medium/large). | `ask_user_questions`, `gsd_summary_save(PROJECT)`, `gsd_research_decision_save` (only when the user asks for research) |
| `guided-discuss-requirements.md` | Interview-style requirements capture. | `ask_user_questions`, `gsd_requirement_save`, `gsd_summary_save(REQUIREMENTS)`, `gsd_research_decision_save` (only when the user asks for research) |
| `guided-research-project.md` | Spawns 4 parallel scout subagents (stack, features, architecture, pitfalls). Headless. | `subagent` × 4 |

### 5c. Milestone Planning Flow

```
discuss-milestone  OR  discuss-headless  (headless = no questions)
         │
         ▼
research-milestone  (optional, based on complexity)
         │
         ▼
plan-milestone
         │
         ▼
parallel-research-slices  (all slices at once)
         │
         ▼
plan-slice  (per slice, sequential)
```

| Prompt | Purpose | Key Tools Called |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| `discuss.md` | Interactive milestone discussion. Layered Q&A: Scope → Architecture → Error States → Quality Bar. | `ask_user_questions`, `gsd_summary_save(CONTEXT)`, `gsd_milestone_set_dependencies` |
| `guided-discuss-milestone.md` | Same as discuss.md but interview-driven, with draft saves. | `ask_user_questions`, `gsd_summary_save(CONTEXT)` |
| `discuss-headless.md` | Create milestone CONTEXT from spec with no user interaction. | `gsd_plan_milestone`, `gsd_decision_save`, `gsd_milestone_set_dependencies` |
| `research-milestone.md` | Strategic research before planning. Narrates findings. | `gsd_summary_save(RESEARCH)` |
| `plan-milestone.md` | Decompose milestone into slices. Plans first slice inline if single-slice. | `gsd_plan_milestone`, `gsd_plan_slice`, `gsd_plan_task`, `gsd_decision_save` |
| `parallel-research-slices.md` | Spawn one scout subagent per slice simultaneously. Retries once on failure. | `subagent` × N |
| `plan-slice.md` | Decompose one slice into tasks. Every persisted Task declares `requiredWorkflowTools` (`[]` for ordinary work), and planning rejects tools unavailable to both execution variants. Progressive planning uses sketches for S02+. | `memory_query`, `gsd_plan_slice`, `gsd_plan_task` |
| `refine-slice.md` | Expand sketched slice plan into full task breakdown. | `gsd_plan_slice` |
| `guided-discuss-slice.md` | Interview-driven slice scoping. | `ask_user_questions`, `gsd_summary_save(CONTEXT)` |
| `guided-research-slice.md` | Scout a slice. | `memory_query`, `gsd_summary_save(RESEARCH)` |
| `research-slice.md` | Research a slice (non-guided, auto-mode). | `memory_query`, `gsd_summary_save(RESEARCH)` |

### 5d. Execution Flow

```
reactive-execute  (≥3 ready tasks → parallel)
    OR
execute-task  (single task → sequential)
         │
         ▼
guided-resume-task  (if task was interrupted)
```

| Prompt | Purpose | Key Tools Called |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| `execute-task.md` | Execute a single task. Inlines full context stack. | `memory_query`, `gsd_task_complete` |
| `reactive-execute.md` | Dispatch all ready tasks in parallel subagents. When batch tasks are still not closed and have no Attempt Result after retries, records a recovery block and writes a diagnostic slice blocker; task lifecycle still follows DB Attempt/recovery authority, not summary-file presence. | `subagent` × N |
| `guided-resume-task.md` | Resume interrupted task. The saved Work Checkpoint row of the task is inlined as `{{resumeState}}`. | `gsd_task_complete`, `gsd_checkpoint_save` |
| `quick-task.md` | Lightweight task outside milestone structure. No DB tools. | writes `{{summaryPath}}` directly |

### 5e. Quality Gates

```
gate-evaluate  (parallel gate subagents)

complete-slice  (writes the slice summary and UAT spec)
         │
         ▼
run-uat  (per-slice user acceptance assessment)
         │
         ▼
validate-milestone  (3 parallel reviewers after all slices close)
```

| Prompt | Purpose | Key Tools Called |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| `gate-evaluate.md` | Spawn one subagent per quality gate in parallel. Verifies `gsd_save_gate_result` called. | `subagent` × N |
| `validate-milestone.md` | 3 parallel reviewers: (A) requirements, (B) integration, (C) acceptance. | `subagent` × 3, `gsd_validate_milestone` |
| `run-uat.md` | Execute UAT. Modes: artifact-driven, browser-executable, runtime-executable, live-runtime, mixed, human-experience. Runs under `verification` tools policy with UAT-owned execution plus safe read-only/browser inspection tools. | `gsd_uat_result_save`, read-only/browser tools |

`run-uat` completion verification requires the run-uat assessment row that `gsd_uat_result_save` records with its verdict (`PASS | FAIL | PARTIAL`). An `S##-ASSESSMENT.md` file, with or without a `verdict` field, does not satisfy artifact verification.
`src/resources/extensions/gsd/uat-policy.ts` is the shared policy source for UAT mode classification, browser-tool requirements, dispatch decisions, and result-save mode validation.

### 5f. Completion Flow

```
complete-slice
         │
         ▼
reassess-roadmap  (after each slice)
         │
         ▼
complete-milestone
```

| Prompt | Purpose | Key Tools Called |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| `complete-slice.md` | Close slice after tasks pass. Compress summary; may reopen/replan pending task rework before closeout. | `gsd_slice_complete`, `gsd_task_reopen`, `gsd_replan_slice`, `gsd_replan_task`, `gsd_rework_brief_save`, `gsd_requirement_update` |
| `reassess-roadmap.md` | Review roadmap post-slice and validate success-criterion coverage. Uses `metadataCorrections` for DB-backed acceptance or completed-slice evidence fixes without changing completed structure; requirement status terminalization stays in completion units. | `gsd_reassess_roadmap` |
| `complete-milestone.md` | Close milestone. Persist to DB. | `gsd_complete_milestone`, `gsd_requirement_update`, `capture_thought` |

### 5g. Maintenance & Repair

| Prompt | Purpose | Key Tools Called |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| `replan-slice.md` | Replan after a blocker discovered mid-slice. Preserves completed Tasks; every updated Task declares execution-compatible `requiredWorkflowTools`. | `gsd_replan_slice` |
| `replan-task.md` | Replace one pending Task plan for a durable recovery action. Declares execution-compatible `requiredWorkflowTools` before a replacement Attempt can be claimed. | `gsd_replan_task` |
| `rethink.md` | Reorder, park, unpark, skip, or discard milestones, and change dependencies. | `gsd_skip_slice`, `gsd_milestone_reorder`, `gsd_milestone_park`, `gsd_milestone_unpark`, `gsd_milestone_discard`, `gsd_milestone_set_dependencies`; `QUEUE-ORDER.json` and `PARKED.md` are rendered from the DB |
| `worktree-merge.md` | Merge a worktree branch into a target branch from the main tree. Managed `.gsd` projections are not hand-merged; GSD renders them again from the database after the merge commit. | git merge (main tree CWD) |
| `reassess-roadmap.md` | *(see Completion Flow above)* | — |
| `rewrite-docs.md` | Apply active steer overrides (database rows, rendered to OVERRIDES.md) across all plans. Planning files are not edited; they are rendered from the DB. | `gsd_plan_task`, `gsd_plan_slice`, `gsd_decision_save`, `gsd_requirement_update`, `gsd_summary_save(PROJECT)` |
| `review-migration.md` | Audit `.planning → .gsd` migration correctness. | `deriveState` |
| `doctor-heal.md` | Repair broken GSD artifacts (summaries, UAT, CONTEXT) in the DB; rendered files are not edited. | `gsd_summary_save`, `gsd_uat_result_save`, `gsd_milestone_status` |
| `scan.md` | Codebase scan → STACK.md, INTEGRATIONS.md, ARCHITECTURE.md. No tool calls. | writes `{{outputDir}}` |
| `forensics.md` | Debug GSD engine failures. Map failures to source files. | reads activity logs, journal, metrics |
| `debug-diagnose.md` | Root-cause analysis for reported bugs. | `capture_thought`, `memory_query` |
| `debug-session-manager.md` | Manage debug session with checkpoint protocol. Structured return headers. | — |
| `add-tests.md` | Generate tests for completed slices. | skill activation |
| `triage-captures.md` | Classify user thoughts captured with `capture_thought`. | `ask_user_questions`, `gsd_capture_resolve` |
| `queue.md` | Add future milestones to queue. | `gsd_milestone_generate_id`, `gsd_summary_save(CONTEXT)`, `gsd_milestone_set_dependencies`; `QUEUE.md` is rendered from the DB |

### 5h. Workflow Execution (one-off workflows, not milestone-driven)

| Prompt | Purpose | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| `workflow-start.md` | Execute a templated workflow (phases, complexity gates, artifact directory). | Follows phases in order, writes artifacts, atomic commits |
| `workflow-oneshot.md` | Execute a oneshot workflow (no STATE.json). | prompt-only, no scaffolding |

## 6. Full Dependency Graph

### 6a. Sequential Chains

"writes" below means: the unit commits rows through Domain Operations and the
named files render from them (the writer matrix lives in
`docs/dev/state-db-cutover-projection-contract.md`). The database is the
authority; the file is the view.

## 7. Artifact Flow (What Each Phase Writes)

Each phase commits database rows (Domain Operations, workflow rows, artifact
rows) and the named `.gsd/` file is a projection rendered from those rows —
the same file re-renders on rebuild. `.gsd/PREFERENCES.md` and `CODEBASE.md`
are not workflow projections: PREFERENCES.md is operator preference frontmatter,
CODEBASE.md a generated codebase map.

```
Phase                   Artifact Written
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
guided-workflow-preferences  →  .gsd/PREFERENCES.md
guided-discuss-project       →  .gsd/PROJECT.md
guided-discuss-requirements  →  .gsd/REQUIREMENTS.md
guided-research-project      →  .gsd/phases/<NN-slug>/<NN>-RESEARCH.md (×4 aspects)

discuss / guided-discuss-milestone  →  .gsd/phases/<NN-slug>/<NN>-CONTEXT.md
research-milestone           →  .gsd/phases/<NN-slug>/<NN>-RESEARCH.md
plan-milestone               →  .gsd/phases/<NN-slug>/<NN>-ROADMAP.md
                                 .gsd/phases/<NN-slug>/<NN>-<MM>-PLAN.md (single-slice fast path)

research-slice               →  .gsd/phases/<NN-slug>/<NN>-<MM>-RESEARCH.md
guided-discuss-slice         →  .gsd/phases/<NN-slug>/<NN>-<MM>-CONTEXT.md
plan-slice / refine-slice    →  .gsd/phases/<NN-slug>/<NN>-<MM>-PLAN.md
                                 (task planning is embedded; no separate task plan file)

execute-task                 →  .gsd/phases/<NN-slug>/S##-T##-SUMMARY.md
gate-evaluate                →  gate results (DB + artifact)
run-uat                      →  .gsd/phases/<NN-slug>/<NN>-<MM>-ASSESSMENT.md
complete-slice               →  .gsd/phases/<NN-slug>/<NN>-<MM>-SUMMARY.md
reassess-roadmap             →  updates <NN>-ROADMAP.md (slice statuses)
validate-milestone           →  validation verdict (DB)
complete-milestone           →  .gsd/phases/<NN-slug>/<NN>-SUMMARY.md

triage-captures              →  capture.resolved events (gsd_capture_resolve); .gsd/CAPTURES.md is the render
queue                        →  .gsd/QUEUE.md, updates PROJECT.md
scan                         →  {{outputDir}}/STACK.md, INTEGRATIONS.md, ARCHITECTURE.md
rewrite-docs                 →  DECISIONS.md, task plans, REQUIREMENTS.md, PROJECT.md
```

## 8. Skill System Dependency

```
skill-catalog.ts   (tech-stack → repo + skill names)
       │

skill-discovery.ts (resolves installed skills for current project)
       │

## 9. Tool → DB Write Map

The authoritative tool read/write/projection inventory is in the
[database map](./db-map.md). Lifecycle atomicity, replay, and
projection-delivery contracts are owned by the
[lifecycle command integration runbook](./dev/lifecycle-command-integration-runbook.md).

## 10. Dispatch Rule Priority Order

`auto-dispatch.ts` evaluates 29 rules top-to-bottom, first match wins. Source of
truth is the `DISPATCH_RULES` array in `auto-dispatch.ts`; the canary test
`tests/dispatch-rule-coverage.test.ts` pins the count.

```
Priority  Rule                                          Fires When
────────  ────────────────────────────────────────────  ─────────────────────────
 1        escalating-task → pause-for-escalation        a task escalation is awaiting user review
 2        rewrite-docs (override gate)                  active override rows in the database
 3        stored retry → execute-task (commit repair)   the commit hook refused the changes of a closed task and the retry is stored on the task's dispatch row
 4        summarizing → complete-slice                  slice in 'summarizing' phase
 5        run-uat (post-completion)                     slice complete, stored UAT spec, no run-uat verdict row
 6        reassess-roadmap (post-completion)            slice closed, no roadmap assessment row
 7        needs-discussion → discuss-milestone          milestone explicitly flagged for discussion
 8        deep: workflow-preferences                    deep mode + workflow preferences fact not recorded (in-process, no unit)
 9        deep: discuss-project                         deep mode + no valid PROJECT artifact row
10        deep: discuss-requirements                    deep mode + no valid REQUIREMENTS artifact row
11        deep: research-project                        deep mode + recorded decision is `research`, files missing
12        pre-planning (no context) → discuss-milestone active milestone, no saved CONTEXT row
13        pre-planning (no research) → research-mile…   CONTEXT saved, no saved RESEARCH row
14        pre-planning (has research) → plan-milestone  CONTEXT + RESEARCH saved, no slice rows
15        planning (require_slice_discussion) → pause   slice has no saved CONTEXT row (#3454)
16        planning (multi slices need research) → par…  slices planned, saved slice RESEARCH missing × ≥2
17        planning (no research) → research-slice       single slice has no saved RESEARCH row
18        refining → refine-slice                       slice is sketch, needs expansion
19        planning → plan-slice                         slice has no task rows
20        stored retry → plan-slice / refine-slice      the pre-execution check refused the slice plan and the retry is stored on the planner's dispatch row
21        evaluating-gates → gate-evaluate              gates pending evaluation
22        replanning-slice → replan-slice               slice in 'replanning' phase
23        executing → replan-task recovery              pending Task recovery action for the active task
24        executing → reactive-execute (parallel)       ≥3 tasks ready (parallel mode), no recorded reactive block, no selected task with a lifecycle row
25        executing → execute-task (render plan)        slice PLAN file missing — render it from the DB, then fall through
26        executing → execute-task                      1–2 tasks ready (sequential mode)
27        validating-milestone → validate-milestone     all slices closed, not yet validated
28        completing-milestone → complete-milestone     validated, not yet completed
29        complete → stop                               nothing left to do
```

## 11. How to Read the Map

- **Box** = a prompt file (`prompts/X.md`)
- **Arrow →** = "produces" or "writes"
- **Dashed →** = "reads from"
- **×N** = spawns N parallel subagents each running that prompt
- **[gate]** = requires explicit user confirmation before proceeding
- **DB** = persists to `gsd.db` via a `gsd_*` tool call
- **Headless** = no `ask_user_questions` calls; autonomous judgment
