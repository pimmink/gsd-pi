# @opengsd/mcp-server

MCP server exposing GSD orchestration tools for Claude Code, Cursor, and other MCP-compatible clients.

Start GSD auto-mode sessions, poll progress, resolve blockers, and retrieve results — all through the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/).

This package always exposes two bridge-independent tool surfaces:

- session/read tools for starting and inspecting GSD sessions
- MCP-native interactive tools for structured user input

When workflow bridges are available, it also exposes headless-safe workflow tools for planning, completion, validation, reassessment, metadata persistence, and journal reads.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @opengsd/mcp-server
```

The published package installs without the bundled-only `@gsd/pi-ai` package. A standalone process starts with the bridge-independent tool surfaces; see [Workflow tools](#workflow-tools) to enable workflow mutation tools.

Or with the monorepo workspace:

```bash
# Already available as a workspace package
npx gsd-mcp-server
```

## Configuration

### Claude Code

Add to your project's `.mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gsd": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["gsd-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "GSD_CLI_PATH": "/path/to/gsd"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Or if installed globally:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gsd": {
      "command": "gsd-mcp-server"
    }
  }
}
```

### Cursor

Add to `.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gsd": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["gsd-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "GSD_CLI_PATH": "/path/to/gsd"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

When workflow bridges are enabled, the packaged MCP server advertises only the canonical workflow tool names above by default. Legacy aliases are compatibility names and are not included in `tools/list` unless `GSD_MCP_ADVERTISE_ALIASES=1` is set. Prefer moving clients and prompts to canonical names before enabling aliases, because aliases duplicate schemas in the model-facing tool surface.

These tools use the same GSD workflow handlers as the native in-process tool path wherever a shared handler exists.

Durable workflow mutations are atomic and replay-safe where they cross the canonical lifecycle boundary. Planning mutations (`gsd_plan_milestone`, `gsd_plan_slice`, `gsd_plan_task`, `gsd_replan_slice`, `gsd_replan_task`, and `gsd_reassess_roadmap`), decision saves (`gsd_decision_save` / `gsd_save_decision`), requirement saves and updates (`gsd_requirement_save`, `gsd_requirement_update` and their aliases), gate results (`gsd_save_gate_result`), rework briefs (`gsd_rework_brief_save`), memory captures (`gsd_capture_thought`), artifact saves (`gsd_summary_save` / `gsd_save_summary`), UAT results (`gsd_uat_result_save`), task execution completion (`gsd_task_complete` / `gsd_complete_task`), repaired recovery resumption (`gsd_task_recovery_resume`), adopted-Milestone validation, subjective UAT, completion, or reopen (`gsd_validate_milestone`, `gsd_prepare_milestone_subjective_uat`, `gsd_complete_milestone`, and `gsd_milestone_reopen`), and Milestone ID generation, park, unpark, discard, reorder, and dependency changes (`gsd_milestone_generate_id` / `gsd_generate_milestone_id`, `gsd_milestone_park`, `gsd_milestone_unpark`, `gsd_milestone_discard`, `gsd_milestone_reorder`, and `gsd_milestone_set_dependencies`) prefer a nonblank private `_meta["io.opengsd/idempotency-key"]` value. A retry must resend the same value across requests and server processes. Claude Code clients may instead rely on the private `_meta["claudecode/toolUseId"]` value that Claude Code preserves across its MCP session-recovery retry; the server places that value in a reserved transport namespace. An explicit OpenGSD key takes precedence, and a malformed explicit key fails closed instead of falling back. Requests without either replay-stable identity fail before mutation. A subjective UAT answer has no MCP tool: only the user records it, with `/gsd uat-answer` in the terminal UI. A session that `gsd_execute` starts refuses that command. This metadata is not a tool parameter and does not change the public tool schema or response. Canonical names and compatibility aliases resolve to the same operation identity.

Workflow mutations are fenced against a stale view. The server keeps, per MCP session and project, the project revision that the last `gsd_milestone_status` or `gsd_project_snapshot` call returned. The next mutation of that session fails with `stale view: the project changed after this session last read it` when another writer moved the revision after that read. A stored `ask_user_questions` round moves the revision but changes no state that the session read, so it does not make the view stale. Read the status again, then retry. A session that has not read since its last write uses the current revision. The revision is server-side state, not a tool parameter, and a replay of a committed request is not checked.

`gsd_task_recovery_resume` is a repair command exposed to `execute-task`, not an ordinary task-completion tool. It requires the exact current agent-owned `abort` or `remediate` `recoveryActionId`, a plain-language `repairSummary`, and non-empty structured `evidence`. It appends an immutable repair checkpoint and authorizes one lineage-linked Task Attempt; it does not delete the Recovery Action, reset its budget, mark the Task skipped, or authorize later Attempts.

**Opt-in aliases (kept for backwards compatibility — prefer the canonical name above):** `gsd_save_decision`, `gsd_update_requirement`, `gsd_save_requirement`, `gsd_save_summary`, `gsd_generate_milestone_id`, `gsd_milestone_plan`, `gsd_slice_plan`, `gsd_task_plan`, `gsd_slice_replan`, `gsd_complete_task`, `gsd_complete_slice`, `gsd_milestone_validate`, `gsd_milestone_complete`, `gsd_roadmap_reassess`, `gsd_reopen_task`, `gsd_reopen_slice`, `gsd_reopen_milestone`.

`gsd_decision_save` persists new decisions to the ADR-013 memory store, not to the legacy `decisions` table. If alias advertising is enabled, `gsd_save_decision` delegates to the same behavior. The assigned `D###` ID is recorded in `memories.structured_fields.sourceDecisionId`, and `.gsd/DECISIONS.md` is refreshed as a projection from memory-backed decisions. To replace an earlier decision, set the optional `supersedes` field to its `D###` ID: the old decision is marked superseded in the same operation, and only an active decision can be superseded. The legacy table may still be read by compatibility and inspection paths during the cutover window, but it is no longer a write target.

`gsd_summary_save` computes artifact paths from the supplied IDs. `milestone_id` is required for milestone-, slice-, and task-scoped artifact types (`SUMMARY`, `RESEARCH`, `CONTEXT`, `ASSESSMENT`, `CONTEXT-DRAFT`) and should be omitted only for root-level `PROJECT`, `PROJECT-DRAFT`, `REQUIREMENTS`, and `REQUIREMENTS-DRAFT` artifacts. The `content` field has a schema `maxLength` of 50,000 characters per save; callers that produce larger artifacts should save incrementally by writing a substantive draft, then re-save the enriched artifact as more detail is available. For final `REQUIREMENTS` saves, the tool renders content from active database requirement rows; callers must create those rows with `gsd_requirement_save` first.

`gsd_replan_task` updates one existing pending task's planning contract after rework without replacing sibling tasks. `projectDir` is optional; when omitted, the server uses its current project or worktree root. Required parameters are `milestoneId`, `sliceId`, `taskId`, `title`, `description`, `estimate`, `files`, `verify`, `inputs`, and `expectedOutput`; `reworkBriefRef` is optional and records the brief that triggered the update. The tool rejects missing tasks and legacy-closed or canonically completed/cancelled tasks; use `gsd_task_reopen` before replanning terminal work.

Planning and replanning never physically delete adopted work. Tasks removed by `gsd_plan_slice` or `gsd_replan_slice`, and slices removed by `gsd_reassess_roadmap`, are retained as cancelled history and omitted from active plan/roadmap projections. Reusing one of those IDs requires the corresponding `gsd_task_reopen` or `gsd_slice_reopen` call first.

`gsd_plan_milestone` cannot remove an existing slice. Use `gsd_reassess_roadmap` for an intentional pending-slice removal; completed slices remain protected.

`gsd_rework_brief_save` persists structured rework findings for a task. `projectDir` is optional; required parameters are `milestoneId`, `sliceId`, `taskId`, and a non-empty `findings` array. Each finding requires `findingId`, `severity` (`blocking` or `advisory`), `description`, `requiredFix`, and `verificationCommands`; optional fields are `status`, `evidence`, and `decisionRef`.

Blocking findings saved by `gsd_rework_brief_save` gate `gsd_task_complete`. To complete the task, the `gsd_task_complete` call must include a `reworkResolution` entry for each pending blocking `findingId` with `status: "resolved"` and non-empty `evidence`. Deferred findings must use `status: "deferred-with-override"` with non-empty `evidence` and a `decisionRef`.

`gsd_checkpoint_save` saves a Work Checkpoint row for a milestone, slice or task. `projectDir` is optional; required parameters are `milestoneId`, `kind` (`pause` or `handoff`), `confirmedContext`, and `nextAction`; optional fields are `sliceId`, `taskId`, `unresolved`, and `evidence`. The row is the resume state: the next session reads it from the database. `CONTINUE.md` is rendered from the row and is never read back.

For canonical auto-mode task execution, `gsd_task_complete` stages the executor result for the running Attempt instead of publishing task completion immediately. A successful call returns `details.attemptId`, `details.resultId`, `details.summaryPath`, and `details.nextStage`; `nextStage: "verify"` means the host must still run technical verification before completion is published, while `nextStage: "route"` means the executor reported a blocker or failed result that should be routed for recovery. After host verification records a passing Technical Verdict for the same source revision, auto mode publishes the task completion and refreshes the summary and plan projections. MCP clients should call this tool only for the active task Attempt they are executing; calls without a running or replay-matched canonical Attempt fail instead of falling back to legacy completion.

### Interactive tools

The packaged server exposes `ask_user_questions` through MCP form elicitation. This keeps the existing GSD answer payload shape while allowing Claude Code CLI and other elicitation-capable clients to surface structured user choices.

The packaged server also exposes `secure_env_collect` through MCP form elicitation. Secret values are written directly to the selected destination and are not included in tool output. For dotenv writes, `envFilePath` must resolve inside the validated project directory; parent traversal and symlink escapes are rejected.

`secure_env_collect` refuses to set variables that control the MCP server runtime itself, including `GSD_WORKFLOW_EXECUTORS_MODULE`, `GSD_WORKFLOW_WRITE_GATE_MODULE`, `GSD_WORKFLOW_PROJECT_ROOT`, `GSD_CLI_PATH`, `NODE_OPTIONS`, `NODE_PATH`, `PATH`, `LD_PRELOAD`, and `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES`. These values must be configured by the operator in the MCP server environment, not collected from an MCP tool call.

Secret handling differs by destination:

- `dotenv`: accepted values are written to the project env file and hydrated into the current MCP server process so the active session can use them.
- `vercel` and `convex`: accepted values are pushed to the remote destination but are not added to `process.env`; restart or configure the consuming runtime normally if the current process needs that value.

Current support boundary:

- when running inside the GSD monorepo checkout, the MCP server auto-discovers the shared workflow executor module
- a direct standalone install without workflow bridges serves the session, read, and interactive tools but omits workflow mutation tools
- outside the monorepo, set `GSD_WORKFLOW_EXECUTORS_MODULE` and `GSD_WORKFLOW_WRITE_GATE_MODULE` to importable bridge module paths to enable workflow mutation tools
- `ask_user_questions` and `secure_env_collect` require an MCP client that supports form elicitation

Configured workflow startup remains fail-closed: `gsd-mcp-server` loads the workflow executor and write-gate bridge before it connects over stdio. If either configured or co-located bridge fails to load, the MCP host sees a startup failure instead of a partially advertised workflow surface.

The server also keeps a per-project PID registry at `$GSD_HOME/mcp-instances.json` (default `~/.gsd/mcp-instances.json`). On startup it terminates a previously registered `gsd-mcp-server` process for the same project when the saved PID still belongs to an MCP server, then records the current PID. On normal shutdown it removes only its own entry. Corrupt registry files are preserved as `.corrupt-<timestamp>` backups before a new registry is written.

When the recorded holder is alive but cannot be verified as this project's server (its working directory or command line does not match the registered project root), startup is refused and the refusal names the holder's PID, working directory, and the `startedAt` timestamp recorded in the registry when the holder registered (not the OS process start time). The remedy: kill the holder if it is stale, or restart with `GSD_MCP_CLIENT_MANAGED=1` to skip the per-project registry.

For stdio hosts that leave child processes behind, the server watches stdin activity. If stdin is idle for five minutes and the original parent process is gone, it cleans up sessions, unregisters its PID, and exits.

### `gsd_execute`

Start a GSD auto-mode session for a project directory.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `projectDir` | `string` | ✅ | Absolute path to the project directory |
| `command` | `string` | | Command to send (default: `"/gsd auto"`) |
| `model` | `string` | | Model ID override |
| `bare` | `boolean` | | Run in bare mode (skip user config) |

**Returns:** `{ sessionId, status: "started" }`

Session lifetime: a session started through `gsd_execute` lives inside the server process, which is connected to one MCP client — when that client's connection closes, the server shuts down and stops the session's process, so a run started this way may end before completing. The success result therefore carries `lifetime: "client-connection"` with that guidance (the tool description says the same), and auto runs that must outlive the connection should be started from a durable long-lived host (for example a TUI or the daemon) instead. `GSD_MCP_CLIENT_MANAGED=1` does not change this lifetime; it only omits the disclosure for clients that own the server's lifecycle themselves.

### `gsd_status`

Poll the current status of a running GSD session.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `sessionId` | `string` | ✅ | Session ID from `gsd_execute` |

**Returns:**

```json
{
  "status": "running",
  "progress": { "eventCount": 42, "toolCalls": 15 },
  "recentEvents": [ ... ],
  "pendingBlocker": null,
  "cost": { "totalCost": 0.12, "tokens": { "input": 5000, "output": 2000, "cacheRead": 1000, "cacheWrite": 500 } },
  "durationMs": 45000
}
```

### `gsd_result`

Get the accumulated result of a session. Works for both running (partial) and completed sessions.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `sessionId` | `string` | ✅ | Session ID from `gsd_execute` |

**Returns:**

```json
{
  "sessionId": "abc-123",
  "projectDir": "/path/to/project",
  "status": "completed",
  "durationMs": 120000,
  "cost": { ... },
  "recentEvents": [ ... ],
  "pendingBlocker": null,
  "error": null
}
```

### `gsd_cancel`

Cancel a running session. Aborts the current operation and stops the agent process.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `sessionId` | `string` | ✅ | Session ID from `gsd_execute` |

**Returns:** `{ cancelled: true }`

### `gsd_cancel_by_project`

Cancel the active session for a project directory when `sessionId` is unavailable (e.g. Hermes `/gsd cancel`).

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `projectDir` | `string` | ✅ | Absolute path to the project directory |

**Returns:** `{ cancelled: true, projectDir: "..." }`

### `gsd_query`

Query GSD project state without an active session. Returns the state, project and requirements documents and the milestone listing.

When the GSD runtime is available, the tool reads the workflow database: the documents are built from database rows and each milestone has its `title` and `status`. When the project has no openable database, the tool reads the `.gsd/` files and `readMetadata` says so. `gsd_roadmap`, `gsd_doctor` and the `gsd_graph` build follow the same rule and also return `readMetadata`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `projectDir` | `string` | ✅ | Absolute path to the project directory |
| `query` | `string` | | Narrow the response: `"state"`/`"status"`, `"project"`, `"requirements"`, `"milestones"` or `"all"` (default) |

**Returns:**

```json
{
  "projectDir": "/path/to/project",
  "query": "all",
  "state": "...",
  "project": "...",
  "requirements": "...",
  "milestones": [
    { "id": "M001", "title": "Foundation", "status": "active", "hasRoadmap": true, "hasSummary": false }
  ],
  "readMetadata": { "source": "database", "authority": "db-authoritative" }
}
```

The projection fallback returns `readMetadata: { "source": "projection", "authority": "projection-fallback" }` and milestones without `title` and `status`.

### `gsd_resolve_blocker`

Resolve a pending blocker. There are two kinds:

- A UI request that a live session waits on. Pass `sessionId`. This blocker exists only while the session runs.
- An open escalation in the project database. Pass `projectDir`. This blocker is a database row, so the call needs no session and works after a server restart. `gsd_project_snapshot` lists it under `openQuestions`. The database is used only when `projectDir` is given: a call with only `sessionId` never resolves an escalation, and with both parameters `sessionId` is not used.

To resolve an escalation is a workflow mutation. The server refuses it while a discussion gate waits for the user and in queue mode. The request must carry the replay-stable `_meta` identity of a workflow mutation (see [Workflow tools](#workflow-tools)). The answer and its decision record the MCP caller: transport `workflow-mcp`, actor `agent`, and `made_by: agent`. Only `/gsd escalate resolve` records a response from the user.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `sessionId` | `string` | | Session ID from `gsd_execute` |
| `projectDir` | `string` | | Absolute path to the project directory. Give `sessionId` or `projectDir` |
| `questionId` | `string` | | The open question to resolve. Required only when more than one escalation is open |
| `response` | `string` | ✅ | Response for the pending blocker. For an escalation: `<choice> [rationale]`, where choice is an option id, `accept`, or `reject-blocker` |

**Returns:** `{ resolved: true }` for a session blocker. For an escalation: `{ resolved: true, source: "database", status, message, questionId, milestoneId, sliceId, taskId, decisionId }`.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GSD_CLI_PATH` | Absolute path to the GSD CLI binary. If not set, the server resolves `gsd` via `which`. |
| `GSD_WORKFLOW_EXECUTORS_MODULE` | Optional absolute path or `file:` URL for the shared GSD workflow executor module used by workflow mutation tools. |
| `GSD_WORKFLOW_WRITE_GATE_MODULE` | Optional absolute path or `file:` URL for the shared write-gate module used by workflow mutation tools. |
| `GSD_WORKFLOW_PROJECT_ROOT` | Canonical project root for workflow tools and the per-project MCP PID registry key. Defaults to the server's current working directory. |
| `GSD_MCP_CLIENT_MANAGED` | Set to literal `1` to keep this server out of the per-project PID registry: startup skips the orphan sweep, registration, and unregister-on-shutdown. Use this when the MCP client manages server lifetimes itself and may run more than one server for the same project; it is also the way to start a second server for a project whose registry slot is held by another process. |
| `GSD_MCP_ADVERTISE_ALIASES` | Set to literal `1` to include legacy workflow aliases in the packaged MCP server's `tools/list`. When workflow bridges are enabled, leaving it unset exposes canonical workflow names only. |
| `GSD_MCP_HIDE_ALIASES` | Legacy force-hide switch. Set to literal `1` to keep packaged MCP aliases hidden even when `GSD_MCP_ADVERTISE_ALIASES=1`. |
| `GSD_ADVERTISE_TOOL_ALIASES` | Set to literal `1` to register legacy workflow aliases on the native in-process GSD tool surface. This does not affect the packaged MCP server; use `GSD_MCP_ADVERTISE_ALIASES` for `gsd-mcp-server`. |
| `GSD_HOME` | Global GSD directory. Also controls where `mcp-instances.json` is stored. |

The server also hydrates supported model-provider and tool credentials from `~/.gsd/agent/auth.json` on startup. Keys saved through `/gsd config` or `/gsd keys` become available to the MCP server process automatically, and any explicitly-set environment variable still wins.

Remote secrets pushed by `secure_env_collect` to Vercel or Convex are not hydrated into the MCP server process after the push. Use explicit MCP `env` configuration or a process restart when an operator-level value must be visible to the running server.
